## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first challenge coded with React JS. It was a good practice of React data flow and managing props and state. The components aren't too complex which allowed me to focus on main principles of the library.
